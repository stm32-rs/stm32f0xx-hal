## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Remove duplicate error bits clearing in serial `read()` implementation
- Optimize SPI implementation
- Use `pac` instead of `stm32` for PAC access and soft-deprecate the former

### Added

- Add 16bit SPI transfers
- Another example resembling a stop watch controlled via serial interface

### Fixed

- Incorrect PLLSRC bits when using HSE

## [v0.16.0] - 2020-02-02

### Added

- Another blinky example using a timer interrupt

### Changed

- Added "bypass" parameter to Rcc HSE configuration (breaking change)
- Add "usbsrc" function to Rcc configuration, used for selecting USB clock source
- For STM32F030, require use more specific feature flag, e.g. "stm32f030xc"
- Add `embedded-hal` `blocking::i2c::Read` implementation for I2C
- Added USB driver

### Fixed

- Timer: Fix use of wrong frequency when HCLK != PCLK
