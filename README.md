[_stm32f0xx-hal_](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f0xx-hal) contains a hardware abstraction on top of the peripheral access API for the STMicro STM32F0xx family of microcontrollers.

This crate replaces the [stm32f042-hal](https://github.com/therealprof/stm32f042-hal) by a more ubiquitous version suitable for additional families. The idea behind this crate is to gloss over the slight differences in the various peripherals available on those MCUs so a HAL can be written for all chips in that same family without having to cut and paste crates for every single model.

This crate relies on Adam Greig's fantastic [stm32f0](https://crates.io/crates/stm32f0) crate to provide appropriate register definitions, and implements a partial set of the [embedded-hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits. Some of the implementation was shamelessly adapted from the [stm32f103xx-hal](https://github.com/japaric/stm32f103xx-hal) crate by Jorge Aparicio.

Collaboration on this crate is highly welcome, as are pull requests!

Getting Started
---------------
The `examples` folder contains several example programs. To compile them, one must specify the target device as cargo feature:
```
$ cargo build --features=stm32f030
```

To use stm32f0xx-hal as a dependency in a standalone project the target device feature must be specified in the `Cargo.toml` file:
```
[dependencies]
cortex-m = "0.6.0"
cortex-m-rt = "0.6.8"
stm32f0xx-hal = {version = "0.16", features = ["stm32f030"]}
```

If you are unfamiliar with embedded development using Rust, there are a number of fantastic resources available to help.

Minimum supported Rust version
------------------------------

The minimum supported Rust version at the moment is **1.39.0**. Older versions
**may** compile, especially when some features are not used in your
application.
